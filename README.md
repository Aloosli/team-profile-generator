# Team Profile Generator

## Description
The Team Profile Generator is a Node.js command-line application that allows users to generate an HTML page that displays information about a team of employees. The application prompts the user to enter information about each team member, including their name, ID number, email address, and role within the company. The user can add any number of team members, including managers, engineers, and interns. Once all the necessary information has been entered, the application generates an HTML file that displays the team members' information in a clean, professional format.
